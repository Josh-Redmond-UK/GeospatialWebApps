## Sharing your Shiny App

Its REALLY easy to share your R Shiny application for free. 

Shinyapps.io is a service which allows you to share you apps online for free, with additional paid tiers for better resources and more applications. 

To share your app, you first need to install the rsconnect package. 

``` install.packages('rsconnect')```

Then, head to shinyapps.io and create a free account. I logged in with GitHub. 

Follow the instructions that the website gives you. 

That's it! 

Alternatively, if you click the 'publish' button on the top right of the shiny application script editor, that will prompt you to complete the process to sign up and guide you through deploying your application.
