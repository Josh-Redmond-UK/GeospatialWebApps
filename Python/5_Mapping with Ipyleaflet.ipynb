Using the excellent ipyleaflet we are going to build a basic web map, at first we will just display some data, but we will build up to allowing interaction using the skills you have practiced before. A number of the same ideas, like observers and accessing the attributes of different parts of the map, are important concepts for using ipyleaflet. \n"

    "Now you have an interactive map where users can choose which data to view and explore areas interesting to them. One trick we are employing here is to just load and unload data, rather than calculating NDVI or similar indices on the fly using remote sensing images. You can apply this logic to all kinds of analysis, if your model has a relatively small number of parameters, and it is possible for you to pre-compute all the options beforehand, it might be better for your app to do this and just let users view the data interactively. This saves a lot of computing resources on mobile and web devices which might not be very powerful. It also means users dont have to wait a long time for servers to fetch and return data, perform analysis, crunch numbers, and so on. "
