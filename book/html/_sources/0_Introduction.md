## Overview of Web Apps
### Why might you want to use one?

The term 'Web application' is a bit vague, it can refer to things as diverse as ArcGis Online and Twitter (X). The important thing that makes web apps unique and useful compared to a more traditional website is *interactivity*, the user can use an interface to execute code and see the results of their activity. 

Geospatial and mapping web apps are powerful and popular ways to communicate the results of your research, and can allow the public to engage directly with your work. At their most basic level, they can let a user view and explore data you have generated, and at a more advanced level let users generate data themselves using models and tools you have developed. Much geospatial research is directly relevant to people's everyday lives, and is politically important, so letting people use and share your research can help it have impact outside of academia or industry. 

If you want inspiration, here are some really good examples of scientific web apps:
