## Set Up

For the Python section of this course, you will need the following:

 - A GitHub account
 - A Python environment 
 - An R environment

If you don't have Python and R already installed on your computer, then I recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) and using that to install R and Python, it manages all the difficult bits for you! 

All the files for the course (and these materials) can be found on [this github repo.](https://github.com/Josh-Redmond-UK/GeospatialWebApps) 

Please complete the following tasks:

 - If you haven't already, sign up for GitHub here. 
 - Make sure you have a Python and R environment set up and ready to use. 
 - Download the files in the repository linked above.
